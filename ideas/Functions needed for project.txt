Functions needed for project:

1. function that takes in path and reads in image. into numpy format
	test if file exists at the path
	test if datatype is numpy array
	test if image shape is 3 dimensional (2 spatial, 1 rgb)
		if it's 2d image should be assumed to be greyscale. expand out 1 dimension, to be able to work with it further

2. function that displays numpy array as image for user
	test: see it with your eyes

3. crop. input

Ten rules  (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005412)
Rule 1: Use version control
Rule 2: Document your code and usage
Rule 3: Make common operations easy to control
Rule 4: Version your releases
Rule 5: Reuse software (within reason)
Rule 6: Rely on build tools and package managers for installation
Rule 7: Do not require root or other special privileges to install or run
Rule 8: Eliminate hard-coded paths
Rule 9: Include a small test set that can be run to ensure the software is actually working
Rule 10: Produce identical results when given identical inputs
